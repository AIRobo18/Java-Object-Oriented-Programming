Discussion questions

1) The reason the day and month value get set back to 1 is because there is not such thing as a 32nd day and a 13th month. If something illegal is typed into the statement then the values
   set back to the pre-stored info (1/1/2000).
   
2) dateObj.setMonth(1); causes the NullPointerException error becuase before this statement we set dateObj to null, thus we said to change the month null to 1. Null is nothing and we 
   cannot change nothing into somehting without assigning a value to it first.
