# Java-Object-Oriented-Programming
Here you will find all my work related to the field of Object Oriented Programming. These are projects conducted in my time at University. The higher the number, the more challenging the problem was. I hope this will display my skills in regards to Java programming.

Each lab file will be a different project entirely. We were given a span of 5 days for each lab to complete. Some folders will have just the java codes, while more robust ones will have example runs as well.
